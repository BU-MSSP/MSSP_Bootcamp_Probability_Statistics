\item<3->  \redf{non-real-time online}: Watch and study anytime and anywhere you
  like. 
\item <4-> \bluef{realtime offline/online}: Watch lecture videos
  in the classroom
  or in the zoom, with \magenf{asking and
    answering questions}.


  \medskip
\item <5-> No attendance check!
%   \bci

% \item No class attendance check
% \item You can watch the videos \redf{anytime} and \redf{anywhere.}
% \item You can adjust the speed of studying the materials according to
%   your schedule, as long as you submit the homeworks until the
%   announced deadlines and you show up at the right time for the exams.

%   \eci

% \item<3-> Sometimes, we will open \redf{real-time} \bluef{zoom} classes (maybe biweekly)

\begin{frame}{How to take this course? A designer's perspective}

\bci

\item<1-> Designer's perspective?

\item<2-> In the year of 2022, suppose that unfortunately there is no theory of mathematically studying
the \empr{uncertainty} of some phenomena, events, etc.

\item<3-> You have to design such a theory called "probability". How are you going to do it? Where are you going to start?


\item<3-> You just have other basic mathematical theories such as set theory.

\item<4-> You need to get used to the \redf{English terms} on probability (e.g., sample space = 표본공간, probability density function = 확률밀도함수).

\item<5-> We will take this exciting journey from the next lecture!
