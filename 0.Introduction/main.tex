\plitemsep 0.07in

  \bci
\item<1-> Basically, \redf{Non-real-time} online class, but with a little
  bit of real-time zoom classes (if necessary)


\item<2-> All lecture videos have already been pre-recorded.
  Now available in \bluef{YouTube}. 
\bci

\item No class attendance check
\item You can watch the videos \redf{anytime} and \redf{anywhere.} 
\item You can adjust the speed of studying the materials according to
  your schedule, as long as you submit the homworks until the
  announced deadlines and you show up at the right time for the exams. 
  
  \eci
  
\item<3-> Sometimes, we will open \redf{real-time} \bluef{zoom} classes (maybe biweekly)
  \bci
\item To answer students' questions
\item To give important announcements

\begin{frame}{How to take this course? A designer's perspective}

\bci 

\item<1-> Designer's perspective?

\item<2-> In the year of 2021, suppose that unfortunately there is no theory of mathematically studying
the \empr{uncertainty} of some phenomena, events, etc.  

\item<3-> You have to design such a theory called "probability". How are you going to do it? Where are you going to start? 


\item<3-> You just have other basic mathematical theories such as set theory.

\item<4-> You need to get used to the \redf{English terms} on probability (e.g., sample space = 표본공간, probability density function = 확률밀도함수).

\item<5-> We will take this exciting journey from the next lecture!
