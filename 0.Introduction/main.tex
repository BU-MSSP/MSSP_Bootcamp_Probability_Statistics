\item Most should be via KLMS

- Technical questions about lectures, homework, and etc

\item Please DO NOT individually send emails to Prof. Yung Yi and TAs (or making calls or sending KakaoTalk msgs) about the technical questions (course contents, homework, etc)

\bci
\item  All the questions need to be shared among the students.

\item TAs and Prof. Yung Yi will handle your questions as soon as possible.

\item  But, you can send an email to Prof. Yung Yi for the things that need to be individually discussed.

\begin{frame}{Why Probability?}

\bci

\item<1-> Many things are ''probabilistic''

\item<2-> Assume that you are a designer of the following engineering systems. Good design?

\bci
\item a web server

\item  a communication device like mobile phones

\item an AI-based image classifier 
\eci

\item<3-> From an engineering point of view,

\bci
\item System input

\item Algorithms in systems

\item Analysis of systems

\begin{frame}{How to take this course? A designer's perspective}

\bci 

\item<1-> Designer's perspective?

\item<2-> In the year of 2021, suppose that unfortunately there is no theory of mathematically studying
the \empr{uncertainty} of some phenomena, events, etc.  

\item<3-> You have to design such a theory called "probability". How are you going to do it? Where are you going to start? 


\item<3-> You just have other basic mathematical theories such as set theory.

\item<4-> You need to get used to the \redf{English terms} on probability (e.g., sample space = 표본공간, probability density function = 확률밀도함수).

\item<5-> We will take this exciting journey from the next lecture!
